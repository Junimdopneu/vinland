# Lory Servers for Garry's Mod

## How to configure new addons/servers

Our file structure consists in that way:

```cs
📦 /servers
|__📁_debug // Addons used only on development environment, useful to monitor CPU/Mem
|__📁_shared // Shared addons, all servers can use these addons
|__📁{{server}} // Some server and specific addons for it
|__📃.server-scheme.toml // Server configurations, define which addons a server should have
```

## How to run

Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Download or clone this repository.

We have a tool to help building the server addons, to use it enter on the tool path and run:

    $: npm install && node index {server}

Where `{server}` means to what server you want to build.

After built, your server addons will be in path `build/{server}`, just install it in [your server](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Downloading_a_Dedicated_Server) folder or your gmod.
